# Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Funding Visualizer	

This app pulls data from the [open dataset](http://www.gatesfoundation.org/How-We-Work/Quick-Links/Grants-Database) of B&G Found. Sparked by my interest in 1) being adopted by Bill Gates (because he's the :bomb: dotcom) and 2) poking around the Gates Found site (Context: the startup nonprofit I cofounded -- [FLE](http://learningequality.org) -- could really use a little bit of that money =] )

## To get started

1. Clone the repo
2. Make a virtual environment
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
4. Run `generate_queries.py`
5. Start mongodb
5. When everything is finished, run `acquire_grant_data.py` and wait. It takes a little while. Don't spam BILL!!!! (even though I did, I so sorry)
